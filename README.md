🚀 How It Works
User fills out the form
Validation occurs in real-time
Name, Email, and Message fields are checked.
If an error is found, a message is displayed.
User clicks "Submit"
If the form is valid, a promise-based simulation runs for 2 seconds.
A success message appears.
If there are errors, an alert appears immediately.
