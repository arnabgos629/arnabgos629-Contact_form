🚀 Contact Form with Validation & Submission Simulation

📌 Overview
This project is a modern, fully functional contact form built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It includes real-time validation, dynamic error handling, and simulated form submission to provide users with a seamless experience.

🎯 Features
✔ Form Validation – Ensures proper input for fields like Name, Email, and Message.
✔ Dynamic Error Messages – Uses JavaScript DOM manipulation to display validation errors.
✔ Simulated Submission – Implements a promise-based fake submission to mimic real form processing.
✔ Success Feedback – Displays a confirmation message after successful submission.
✔ Modern Styling – Designed using Tailwind CSS for a sleek look.
✔ Fully Responsive – Works on mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

🚀 How It Works
1️⃣ User fills out the form
2️⃣ Validation occurs in real-time – Name, Email, and Message fields are checked. If an error is found, a message is displayed.
3️⃣ User clicks "Submit"
4️⃣ If the form is valid, a promise-based simulation runs for 2 seconds.
5️⃣ A success message appears. If there are errors, an alert appears immediately.
